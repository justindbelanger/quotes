* quotes

* What's this?
It's a simple, demo Clojure Web app
that displays a random quote on an HTML page.
It also sends user metrics to a configured Riemann instance.

* Why?
This is mostly just a demo of what you can do with Riemann.

It's also (a bit of) a way for me to practice starting
this kind of project from scratch. Sometimes I forget
just what exactly is needed to get a Web app off the ground.
