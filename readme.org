* quotes

* What's this?
It's a simple, demo Clojure Web app
that displays a random quote on an HTML page.
It also sends user metrics to a configured [[https://riemann.io/][Riemann]] instance.
See the [[https://github.com/justindbelanger/quotes_monitoring][Quotes monitoring repo]] for more info about that.

* Why?
This is mostly just a demo of what you can do with Riemann.

It's also (a bit of) a way for me to practice starting
this kind of project from scratch. Sometimes I forget
just what exactly is needed to get a Web app off the ground.
